# Description

This project has 300 users divided between 3 different roles: student, alumni and staff. On the frontend, students and staff are presented in two sections. 
There are plenty of students to take up all the space on screen above the fold. Staff are shown below students. Users can click on the button that says Include Alumni
which should add alumni to the students section.

How can you change the way this app is build on the front end or backend to make it more effective, efficient or improve the user experience? What 
prinicples guide the way you make changes to this app? While refactoring for code readability is always valuable (ie. moving the controller into its own directory), 
for this exercise, try to focus on changes that improve the app performance or user experience.
